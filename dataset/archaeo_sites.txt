Location Quality Key

A = Exact coordinates of site centroid.
B = The site is within a 1km radius’ buffer of the coordinates collected.
C = The site is within a 3km radius’ buffer of the coordinates collected.
D = The site is within a 5km radius’ buffer of the coordinates collected.

Size Quality Key

A = Very high attention to site extent in this phase by the publishers of this data, with a mix of some/all of intensive survey, some excavation  and/or geomorphological study going into the estimate.
B = Rough site extent for this phase from non-systematic survey or only very partial knowledge of sub-surface/geomorphology. 
C = Same estimated size for all phases and difficult to differentiate per phase.
D = Very rough guess for the site’s likely extent in this phase by our project, from qualitative information about site type.
